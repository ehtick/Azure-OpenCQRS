/// Two shapes rather than one with a provider in it. A relational store is read through contexts
/// Entity Framework Core opens; a Cosmos store is read through the SDK the store itself writes with,
/// and has no context to open — its model carries index definitions the Cosmos provider refuses, and
/// there is no dynamic consistency boundary store for it at all. Registering the relational half
/// anyway would leave four contexts nothing can resolve. The Cosmos branch does register the
/// streamed write path (the SDK-based <see cref="IDomainService"/>) so a snapshot can be refreshed,
/// but it wires that onto the same <see cref="CosmosClient"/> the reads use rather than opening a
/// second one; there is still no dynamic consistency boundary service for it.
